# SASA2022

The R script includes code for implementing independent components analysis from scratch, using
non-parametric estimates for entropy. I have provided minimal annotation and will take you
through the script in my session.

The images_SASA file contains a few vectorised images taken from the Berkeley Image Segmentation database
https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/. This can be loaded into R using load(<path to file>'/images_SASA')
and will import into R a matrix called images containing in its columns 8 vectorised images.
